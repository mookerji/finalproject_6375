	For our 6.375 final project, we propose to extend an existing superscalar, out-of-order execution processor using Tomasulo's algorithm. There are several approaches we are considering, which could possibly be combined. First, we could augment an existing SMIPS implementation with multiple-instruction dispatch and complex execution units (e.g., floating point units and vector instructions), exploring various performance tradeoffs. This project will build off of existing implementations for an SMIPS ISA: Nikil Dave's  Bluespec reorder buffer\footnote{\url{http://csg.csail.mit.edu/pubs/memos/Memo-478/memo-478.pdf}.} and other 6.375 explorations in speculative execution in 2005 and 2007\footnote{\begin{itemize}
		\item \url{2005:~http://csg.csail.mit.edu/6.884/projects/group4-report.pdf}
		\item \url{2005:~http://csg.csail.mit.edu/6.884/projects/group2-report.pdf}
		\item \url{2007:~http://csg.csail.mit.edu/6.375/6_375_2007_www/projects/group4_final_report.pdf}
	\end{itemize}}. By starting from an existing project, we will bypass some of the difficulty in verifying and debugging the correctness of an out-of-order execution implementation. 
	
	Second, we could use high-level abstraction within Bluespec to extend an SMIPS Tomasulo algorithm to a generalized register load-store ISA. The notion here is to preserve the branch instruction and storage processing components of our existing SMIPS architecture, and dynamically generate the execution architecture at Bluespec's compile-time. There is some precedent in this idea within flexible instruction set simulators, which use generic instruction models to target many variations of architectures with complex instruction sets\footnote{For example:~\url{http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1151083&type=pdf}.}. To develop this retargetable ISA processor, we will have to find a reference model that both performs well and is efficient in describing architectures and their instruction sets. The remainder of this project will be an exploration of Bluespec's capabilities in generic decoding and dispatching on varying instruction formats.
